# A Palindrome Sorter built in Node

The task:

Build a service that stores a number of palindromes. Needs an endpoint that returns true if the string entered is a palindrome (and false if not), and an endpoint that returns a list of the last 10 palindromes the system has received (does not have to be stored in a DB).
